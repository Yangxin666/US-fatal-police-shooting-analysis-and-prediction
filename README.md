Methodology:   We defined the reporting deviation rate and total absolute reporting deviation rate to evaluate the media's reporting bias.   In WP dataset analysis, we used FP-growth and word cloud to reveal the frequent patterns and DBSCAN clustering to find fatal shooting hotspots. We also implemented correlation analysis to analyze the correlation between multiple numeric attributes and fatal police shooting rate and tested the significance of their correlations. We used T-test/ANOVA to measure the significance of the fatal police shooting rate by categorical attributes.   In fatal police shooting rate prediction, we used results of correlation analysis to select numeric predictors. We constructed a series of regression models, including Kstar, K-Nearest-Neighbor, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, to predict the state level's fatal police shooting rate. In the victims' race prediction, we used Chi-square testing to make variables selection. We built a series of classification models, including Gradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.
